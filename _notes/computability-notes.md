## Solovay Reducibility and Its Extensions

This guide explores the concept of **Solovay reducibility**, a fundamental tool used to compare the relative randomness of real numbers. We will begin by defining the classes of numbers we are interested in, from simple **computable reals** to more complex **computably approximable** ones. We will then introduce the original **Solovay reducibility**, designed for **computably enumerable (c.e.) reals**, and examine its properties. The core of our study will focus on the challenges and successes of extending this reducibility to larger classes of real numbers, revealing why a straightforward extension fails and how a more nuanced approach involving a "tolerance" term leads to a robust and well-behaved system for classifying randomness.

### Foundational Concepts: Real Numbers and Computability

Before we can compare the randomness of numbers, we must first classify them based on how they can be computed or approximated. The theory of computation provides a rich hierarchy of real number classes.

A real number is considered computable if its digits can be generated by an algorithm. This idea was formalized by Alan Turing.

<div class="math-callout math-callout--definition" markdown="1">
  <p class="math-callout__title"><span class="math-callout__label">Definition</span><span class="math-callout__name">(Computable Real)</span></p>

According to Turing, a real number $x \in [0, 1]$ is **computable** if it has a computable binary expansion. This means

$$x = x_A := \sum_{n \in A} 2^{-(n+1)}$$

for some computable set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$.

</div>

Computable reals represent the simplest numbers from a computational standpoint. At the other end of the spectrum are **random reals**, whose binary expansions are maximally complex and disordered. This "chaoticness" can be quantified using the concept of **prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity**, denoted $H$. A sequence $\alpha$ is random if the complexity of its initial segments is high. Specifically, there exists a constant $c$ such that for all lengths $n$, the complexity of the first $n$ bits, $H(\alpha \upharpoonright n)$, is at least $n - c$.

Between the fully computable and the fully random lies a hierarchy of approximable reals. These are numbers that can be approached as the limit of a computable sequence of rational numbers.

* **Computably Enumerable (c.e.) or Left Computable (LC) Reals:** These are limits of increasing computable sequences of rational numbers. They can be approximated effectively from below.
* **Right Computable (RC) Reals:** Symmetrically, these are limits of decreasing computable sequences of rationals.
* **Semi-Computable (SC) Reals:** The union of left computable and right computable reals.
* **Weakly Computable or d-c.e. (WC) Reals:** A real is weakly computable if it is the difference of two c.e. reals. Equivalently, $x$ is in WC if there is a computable sequence of rationals $(x_s)$ converging to $x$ such that the total variation $\sum_{s \in \mathbb{N}} \lvert x_s - x_{s+1} \rvert$ is bounded.
* **Computably Approximable (CA) Reals:** This is the most general class, defined as the limits of any computable sequence of rationals, without restrictions on monotonicity or bounded variation.

There are also classes based on the rate of convergence.

* **Monotonically Computable (MC) Reals:** A real $x$ is in this class if there exists a computable sequence $(x_s)$ converging to it and a constant $c$ such that $\lvert x - x_t \rvert \le c\lvert x - x_s \rvert$ for all $s \le t$.
* **$\omega$-Monotonically Computable ($\omega$-MC) Reals:** This is similar to MC, but the constant $c$ is replaced by a computable function $h(s)$.

These classes form a strict hierarchy of increasing computational complexity. The primary inclusions are:

$$EC \subset LC \subset SC \subset WC \subset CA$$
$$SC \subset MC \subset \omega\text{-}MC \subset CA$$

The classes $WC$ and $\omega\text{-}MC$ are known to be incomparable.

### Solovay Reducibility for C.E. Reals

To compare the relative randomness of c.e. reals, Robert Solovay introduced a notion of reducibility based on the difficulty of approximation. The intuition is that if a real number $y$ is at least as difficult to approximate as another real $x$, then $y$ must be at least as random as $x$. This gives rise to **S-reducibility**.

<div class="math-callout math-callout--definition" markdown="1">
  <p class="math-callout__title"><span class="math-callout__label">Definition</span><span class="math-callout__name">(1.1: Solovay)</span></p>

A c.e. real $x$ is **Solovay reducible** to a c.e. real $y$ (denoted $x \le_S y$) if there are increasing computable sequences of rationals $(x_s) \in ICS(x)$ and $(y_s) \in ICS(y)$, and a constant $c$ such that:

$$(\forall s \in \mathbb{N}) (x - x_s \le c(y - y_s))$$

</div>

This reducibility is reflexive and transitive, creating a degree structure known as **S-degrees**. The crucial link between approximation difficulty and randomness is captured by the **Solovay property**.

<div class="math-callout math-callout--remark" markdown="1">
  <p class="math-callout__title"><span class="math-callout__label">Remark</span><span class="math-callout__name">(Solovay Property)</span></p>

For any c.e. reals $x$ and $y$:

$$x \le_S y \implies (\exists c)(\forall n)(H(x \upharpoonright n) \le H(y \upharpoonright n) + c)$$

</div>

In simple terms, if x is S-reducible to y, the Kolmogorov complexity of x's binary expansion cannot be significantly greater than that of y's. This confirms the intuition that x cannot be "more random" than y.

The structure of S-degrees on c.e. reals is well understood. The lowest degree consists of the computable reals ($EC$). Most importantly, there is a single largest S-degree. A series of results by Chaitin, Solovay, Calude et al., and Kuçera and Slaman established that the following three concepts are equivalent for c.e. reals:

1. **Being a c.e. random real.**
2. **Being an $\Omega$ number** (the halting probability of a universal self-delimited Turing machine).
3. **Being $\Omega$-like** (complete under S-reducibility, meaning every c.e. real is S-reducible to it).

This elegant result shows that **S-reducibility** perfectly characterizes the most random c.e. reals as the complete elements in its degree structure. This success motivates the question of whether this powerful tool can be extended to larger classes of numbers, like the computably approximable (CA) reals.

### Extending Solovay Reducibility: The Straightforward Approach ($S_2$-Reducibility)

The most direct way to extend S-reducibility from the class of c.e. reals (LC) to the class of all computably approximable reals (CA) is to simply relax the requirement that the approximating sequences be increasing. This leads to a new relation, $S_2$-reducibility.

<div class="math-callout math-callout--definition" markdown="1">
  <p class="math-callout__title"><span class="math-callout__label">Definition</span><span class="math-callout__name">($S_2$-reducible)</span></p>

Let $x, y$ be c.a. reals. $x$ is **$S_2$-reducible** to $y$ (denoted $x \le_S^2 y$) if there are computable sequences $(x_s) \in CS(x)$ and $(y_s) \in CS(y)$, and a constant $c$ such that:

$$(\forall s \in \mathbb{N})(\lvert x - x_s \rvert \le c\lvert y - y_s \rvert)$$

</div>

This definition seems promising at first. It correctly coincides with **S-reducibility** when restricted to c.e. reals (Theorem 2.4) and behaves well on the class of monotonically computable (MC) reals, where it is reflexive and transitive (Theorem 2.2). However, **$S_2$-reducibility** exhibits fatal flaws when applied to classes beyond MC, such as the weakly computable (WC) reals.

<div class="math-callout math-callout--theorem" markdown="1">
  <p class="math-callout__title"><span class="math-callout__label">Theorem</span><span class="math-callout__name">($S_2$-reducibility)</span></p>

1. $(\forall x \in EC \setminus \mathbb{Q})(\exists y \in WC)(x \not\le_S^2 y)$;
2. **$S_2$-reducibility** is not transitive on WC.

</div>

The first point of this theorem is deeply problematic. It states that for any irrational computable real $x$, there exists a more complex (weakly computable) real $y$ such that $x$ is not $S_2$-reducible to $y$. This violates the fundamental intuition that computable reals should have the lowest possible randomness and therefore be reducible to any other real. A reducibility that fails to place computable numbers at the bottom of its hierarchy cannot be considered a valid measure of relative randomness. The second point, the failure of transitivity, means that $S_2$-reducibility does not even form a proper partial order on $WC$, preventing the formation of a coherent degree structure. These shortcomings demonstrate that a simple, direct extension is insufficient.

<div class="math-callout math-callout--remark" markdown="1">
  <p class="math-callout__title"><span class="math-callout__label">Remark</span><span class="math-callout__name"></span></p>

The **S-reducibility** can be characterized in several different ways. For example, $x \le_S y$ iff for all $(y_s) \in ICS(y)$, there exists an $(x_s) \in ICS(x)$, a constant $c$ and a computable function $f$ such that $x - x_s \le c(y - y_{f(s)})$ for all $s$. The corresponding extensions of $\le_S$ to $CA$ can also be based on these characterizations. However, they are all strictly stronger than **$S_2$-reducibility** and behave even worse.

</div>

### A More Robust Extension: Reducibility with Tolerance ($S_{2a}$-Reducibility)

The failure of the straightforward extension suggests that a more subtle approach is needed. The key insight is to introduce a small "tolerance" term into the defining inequality. This idea is motivated by an equivalent formulation of the original S-reducibility, where $x - x_s \le c(y - y_s + 2^{-s})$ holds. Generalizing this tolerant form to c.a. reals yields $S_{2a}$-reducibility.

<div class="math-callout math-callout--definition" markdown="1">
  <p class="math-callout__title"><span class="math-callout__label">Definition</span><span class="math-callout__name">(3.1)</span></p>

For $x, y \in CA$, $x$ is **$S_{2a}$-reducible** to $y$ (denoted $x \le_S^{2a} y$) if there are $(x_s) \in CS(x)$, $(y_s) \in CS(y)$ and a constant $c$ such that:

$$(\forall s)(\lvert x - x_s \rvert \le c(\lvert y - y_s \rvert + 2^{-s}))$$

</div>

This small addition of the $2^{-s}$ term has profound consequences, resolving all the issues that plagued $S_2$-reducibility.

<div class="math-callout math-callout--theorem" markdown="1">
  <p class="math-callout__title"><span class="math-callout__label">Theorem</span><span class="math-callout__name">(3.2)</span></p>

1. The $S_{2a}$-reducibility is reflexive and transitive on $CA$.
2. $(\forall x, y \in LC) (x \le_S^{2a} y \iff x \le_S^2 y \iff x \le_S y)$.
3. $(\forall x, y) (x \in EC \ \& \ y \in CA \implies x \le_S^{2a} y)$.

</div>

This theorem confirms that **$S_{2a}$-reducibility** is a natural and well-behaved extension. It forms a proper partial order on the entire class of c.a. reals, it correctly collapses back to the original S-reducibility on c.e. reals, and it properly places the computable reals at the bottom of the hierarchy. Furthermore, this definition is robust, as it is equivalent to other natural formulations.

<div class="math-callout math-callout--theorem" markdown="1">
  <p class="math-callout__title"><span class="math-callout__label">Theorem</span><span class="math-callout__name">(3.3)</span></p>

For c.a. reals $x$ and $y$, $x \le_S^{2a} y$ if and only if for any $(x_s) \in CS(x)$ and $(y_s) \in CS(y)$, there are an increasing computable function $f$ and a constant $c$ such that

$$(\forall s)(\lvert x - x_{f(s)} \rvert \le c(\lvert y - y_{f(s)} \rvert + 2^{-s}))$$

</div>

Finally, for reals that are already known to be random, the tolerance term becomes unnecessary, and **$S_{2a}$-reducibility** is equivalent to the simpler **$S_2$-reducibility**.

<div class="math-callout math-callout--theorem" markdown="1">
  <p class="math-callout__title"><span class="math-callout__label">Theorem</span><span class="math-callout__name">(3.4)</span></p>

If $y$ is random and $x \le_S^{2a} y$, then $x \le_S^2 y$.

</div>

**Proof:** Suppose $x \le_S^{2a} y$ is witnessed by sequences $(x_s)$, $(y_s)$ and constant $c$. Since $y$ is random, there is a constant $c_1$ such that $\lvert y - y_s \rvert \ge c_1 \cdot 2^{-s}$ for all $s$. This implies

$$2^{-s} \le \frac{1}{c_1} \lvert y - y_s \rvert.$$

Substituting this into the $S_{2a}$-reducibility condition gives

$$\lvert x - x_s \rvert \le c(\lvert y - y_s \rvert + 2^{-s}) \le c\left(\lvert y - y_s \rvert + \frac{1}{c_1}\lvert y - y_s \rvert\right) = c\left(1 + \frac{1}{c_1}\right)\lvert y - y_s \rvert.$$

This final inequality is the condition for $x \le_S^2 y$ with a new constant.

### Generalizing to All Real Numbers ($S_{1a}$-Reducibility)

The concept of reducibility can be extended even further to apply to all real numbers, not just those that are computably approximable. This is achieved by defining the reduction using a partial computable function from rationals to rationals. This gives rise to **$S_1$-reducibility** and its tolerant counterpart, **$S_{1a}$-reducibility**.

<div class="math-callout math-callout--definition" markdown="1">
  <p class="math-callout__title"><span class="math-callout__label">Definition</span><span class="math-callout__name">(4.1)</span></p>

Let $x, y$ be reals.

* **$S_1$-reducible:** $x$ is $S_1$-reducible to $y$ (denoted $x \le_S^1 y$) if there exist a partial computable function $f: \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}$ and a constant $c$ such that $y$ is a limit point of $\mathrm{dom}(f)$ which satisfies: $(\forall r \in \mathrm{dom}(f)) (\lvert x - f(r) \rvert \le c\lvert y - r \rvert)$.
* **$S_{1a}$-reducible:** $x$ is $S_{1a}$-reducible to $y$ (denoted $x \le_S^{1a} y$) if the condition is replaced by: $(\forall r \in \mathrm{dom}(f)) (\lvert x - f(r) \rvert \le c(\lvert y - r \rvert + 2^{-l(r)}))$ where $l(r)$ is the length of the rational $r$ represented as a binary word.

</div>

These definitions coincide with their **$S_2$-** and **$S_{2a}$-** counterparts when restricted to the class $CA$ (Theorem 4.2). Unsurprisingly, the version without tolerance, **$S_1$-reducibility**, fails for the same reasons as **$S_2$-reducibility** (Theorem 4.3). In contrast, **$S_{1a}$-reducibility** is well-behaved for all real numbers.

<div class="math-callout math-callout--theorem" markdown="1">
  <p class="math-callout__title"><span class="math-callout__label">Theorem</span><span class="math-callout__name">(4.4)</span></p>

1. $(\forall x, y \in \mathbb{R})(x \in EC \implies x \le_S^{1a} y)$.
2. The $S_{1a}$-reducibility is reflexive and transitive.

</div>

Thus, **$S_{1a}$-reducibility** stands out as the most natural and robust generalization of Solovay's original concept to the domain of all real numbers.

### Relationship with rH-Reducibility and Final Conclusions

Another important reducibility for comparing reals is the **rH-reducibility**, introduced by Downey, Hirschfeldt, and LaForte.

<div class="math-callout math-callout--definition" markdown="1">
  <p class="math-callout__title"><span class="math-callout__label">Definition</span><span class="math-callout__name">(4.5)</span></p>

For reals $x$ and $y$, $x$ is **rH-reducible** to $y$ (denoted $x \le_{rH} y$) if there are a constant $k$ and a computable function $f$ such that for any initial segment of $y$'s binary expansion, $f$ can produce the corresponding initial segment of $x$'s expansion, given one of a small, constant number of "hints". Formally: $(\forall n \in \mathbb{N})(\exists j \le k) (f(y \upharpoonright n, j) \downarrow = x \upharpoonright n)$.

</div>

The **rH-reducibility** is known to have the Solovay property but is strictly weaker than the original S-reducibility on c.e. reals. A key result is that our tolerant **$S_{1a}$-reducibility** implies rH-reducibility.

<div class="math-callout math-callout--theorem" markdown="1">
  <p class="math-callout__title"><span class="math-callout__label">Theorem</span><span class="math-callout__name">(4.6)</span></p>

$$(\forall x, y \in \mathbb{R})(x \le_S^{1a} y \implies x \le_{rH} y)$$

</div>

This establishes a clear hierarchy. **$S_{1a}$-reducibility** (and its variants) is a strong, natural notion of reducibility that implies the weaker but still significant **rH-reducibility**.

<div class="math-callout math-callout--proposition" markdown="1">
  <p class="math-callout__title"><span class="math-callout__label">Corollary</span><span class="math-callout__name">(4.7)</span></p>

Reducibilities $\le_S^2$, $\le_S^{2a}$, $\le_S^1$, and $\le_S^{1a}$ have the Solovay property.

</div>

In summary, **$S_{1a}$-reducibility** appears to be the correct extension of Solovay's work. Its restriction to $CA$ is **$S_{2a}$-reducibility**, and its further restriction to $LC$ is the original S-reducibility. However, despite the success in defining a well-behaved reducibility for c.a. reals, the elegant picture from the c.e. world cannot be fully replicated. A final, crucial result shows that there is no "most random" c.a. real that is complete for these reducibilities.

<div class="math-callout math-callout--theorem" markdown="1">
  <p class="math-callout__title"><span class="math-callout__label">Theorem</span><span class="math-callout__name">(4.8)</span></p>

$$(\forall y \in CA)(\exists x \in CA)(x \not\le_{rH} y)$$

</div>

**Proof:** For any given c.a. real $y$, a new c.a. real $x$ can be constructed via a diagonalization argument. The construction proceeds stage by stage, ensuring that for every possible computable function $\phi_i$ and constant $j$ (which could potentially witness an rH-reduction), there is some length $n$ where $x \upharpoonright n$ differs from all the outputs $\phi_i(y \upharpoonright n, k)$ for $k \le j$. This systematically defeats every possible rH-reduction from $x$ to $y$.

Since **$S_{1a}$-reducibility** implies **rH-reducibility**, this theorem means there is also no **$S_{1a}$-complete** c.a. real. This stands in sharp contrast to the c.e. case, where the c.e. random reals form a complete top degree. The landscape of randomness in the larger class of computably approximable reals is therefore significantly more complex, lacking a single maximal degree of randomness.
