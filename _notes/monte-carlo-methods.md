# Monte Carlo Methods

**Monte Carlo** methods are computational techniques using repeated random sampling to find numerical solutions. A **numerical solution** is an approximate answer to a mathematical problem, expressed as a number or set of numbers, found using algorithms and computations, rather than an exact, closed-form formula (analytical solution)
