# Energy-Based Models

## Training Methods

* How is the expected log-likelihood of a general EBM derived? Where does sampling come into play?
* How does contrastive divergence approximate likelihood maximization?
* How does score matching avoid sampling?
* What problems come up with basic score matching and how are they addressed?
* In what way are contrastive divergence and score matching analogous?
