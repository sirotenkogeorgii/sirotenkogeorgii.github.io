# Markov Chain Monte Carlo

**Markov chain Monte Carlo** (MCMC) is a generic method for *approximate* sampling from an arbitrary distribution. The main idea is to generate a
Markov chain whose limiting distribution is equal to the desired distribution. For many problems, however, these algorithms do not finish in reasonable time or simply fail.
